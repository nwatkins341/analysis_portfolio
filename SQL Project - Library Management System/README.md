# SQL Project - Library Management System
## Aims
<ul>
<li>To practice database architecture (see ERD diagram)</li>
<li>To practice creating complex queries using subqueries, CTE's, and advanced joins</li>
</ul>

## About the dataset
While the book data and the author associated with each book are <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks?resource=download">real</a>, the rest of the data (including author birth date and nationality) was entirely fabricated using Mockaroo and NumPy's randint function. See the data manipulation directory for more details.

## SQL Questions:
<ol>
<li>What book or books are taken out most often?</li>
<li>What are the top 5 (by count) non-English language codes in the book table?</li>
<li>Which borrowers have overdue books?</li>
<li>How much money is the library owed in fees?</li>
<li>What is the breakdown of books borrowed per month?</li>
<li>What percentage of borrowers borrow more than once?</li>
<li>Who are the top 10 most popular authors in the dataset?</li>
<li>What is the breakdown of books with more than 1 author?
<ul><li>And is there really a book with 51 authors??</li></ul></li>
<li>What is the average number of days it takes to return a book?</li>
<li>Which books are checked out and returned on the same day (potentially indicating they are being used as reference books)?</li>
</ol>
