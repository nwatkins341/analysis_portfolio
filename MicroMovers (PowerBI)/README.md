# MicroMovers Dashboard

This dashboard was created using the MySQL classic models dataset. In it, I imagined the needs of a company, MicroMovers, which specializes in business-to-business sales of model cars and other transportation. Specifically, I aimed to create four different interconnected pages that answered these primary questions:
<ol>
  <li>Executive Summary: What is the health of the business like at the current moment? What are the major trends? How are we performing overall?</li>
  <li>Sales Map: Where are the majority of our sales coming from? Which offices are selling to what locations in the world? Are there opportunities for coordination?</li>
  <li>Product Detail: How is product X performing? Where are we making the most sales of it? To whom? How would profits and margins be affected by a pricing change?</li>
  <li>Office Detail: How is X location performing? Who is the top salesman? Who are the biggest clients and products? Which clients have not ordered from us this year?</li>
</ol>
All of this aims to bring insight that is actually aimed at a specific audience, rather than a generic data project with no aims. Feel free to explore and email me at noahwatkins341@gmail.com to get in contact! Or visit www.NoahWatkins.dev for more.
