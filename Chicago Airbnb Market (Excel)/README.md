# Chicago Airbnb Market (Excel)
This project was actually originally created for personal use and later adapted to show off my skills in Excel. I am relocating to Chicago in January of 2024 and I am torn about where I want to live in the city and whether or not I should get a one or two-bedroom apartment. My primary motivation for getting a second bedroom would be to rent the space out on Airbnb for extra income, which is where the primary questions come in:
<ul>
  <li>What will I be paid per hour in the various neighborhoods of Chicago renting out a second bedroom on Airbnb?</li>
  <li>How much does this work offset the average cost of a second bedroom?</li>
  <li>Are there "better" or "worse" neighborhoods for Airbnb?</li>
</ul>

I answer all of these questions and more in my full report PDF. Check it out in my GitHub file or download the full dashboard and dataset to take a closer look at my work. To get in touch with me, email me at noahwatkins341@gmail.com or visit www.NoahWatkins.dev.
